# EVSE Attack Classification using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Built a high-accuracy intrusion detection system for EV charging stations using classical ML (RF, XGBoost, SVM) and deep learning (CNN, ResNet). Achieved 98%+ accuracy with PCA-based dimensionality reduction and visualized results using confusion matrices and performance plots.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Final_EVSE_attack_classification.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook implementing the machine learning pipeline.
- `EVSE_dataset.csv`: Dataset containing labeled EVSE traffic data (normal and attack).

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is:

**Filename**: `EVSE_dataset.csv`

Make sure the file is in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path accordingly.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
