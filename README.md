# EVSE Attack Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting and classifying cyberattacks on Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance the security of EV infrastructure by identifying malicious activity within charging networks through machine learning models trained on network traffic data.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Final_EVSE_attack_classification.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook implementing the machine learning pipeline.
- `EVSE_dataset.csv`: Dataset containing labeled EVSE traffic data (normal and attack).

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is:

**Filename**: `EVSE_dataset.csv`

Make sure the file is in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path accordingly.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
